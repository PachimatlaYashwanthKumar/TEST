## Features

- **Login Page**: Users can enter their username and password to log in. The application supports three unique login credentials.
- **Profile Page**: After logging in, users can enter their biodata in a table format and submit the information.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `src` folder and open `login.html` in a web browser to access the login page.
3. Enter one of the three predefined credentials to log in.
4. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the profile page where you can enter your biodata.

## Usage Guidelines

- Ensure that you have a web server running if you plan to implement data saving functionality, as saving to a folder typically requires backend support.
- Modify the JavaScript files to customize the login credentials and data handling as per your requirements.
